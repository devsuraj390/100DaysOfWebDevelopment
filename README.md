# 100DaysOfWebDevelopment

As the name suggest, this is the 100 Days Challenge to learn Web Development. In this challenege, I will be focusing on the Frontend part of web development. Please note that this is not a guide to learn Front End technologies. This is only created for the sole purpose of practising Front end technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS** &
**JavaScript** and draw a roadmap to go through these technologies.



## Roadmap

- Intoduction to Web
- *Laying* out the content - **HTML**
- Making content *Pretty* - **CSS**
- Add some *Interactivity* - **JavaScript**
